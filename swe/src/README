This directory holds the Swiss Ephemeris library. It can be downloaded from
http://www.astro.com/swisseph/ and used via the GPL licence.

The original directory is stripped down, and the unneded files are deleted (like
the swetest source and such. In the future, even the library may be optimised
further.
